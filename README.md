# Musical Review
I review an album each week with some friends, this seemed like a good place to store things. See the summary below, or the individual files in the reviews directory.

## Summary

### Theme: 90s
#### [Week 1 - Pixies - Bossanova](./reviews/Week%201%20-%20Pixies%20-%20Bossanova.md)

19/30 (Me: 6/10)

Some standout tracks, but sags in places.

Favourite Track: Cecilia Ann

#### [Week 2 - The Chemical Brothers - Dig Your Own Hole](./reviews/Week%202%20-%20The%20Chemical%20Brothers%20-%20Dig%20Your%20Own%20Hole.md)

21/30 (Me: 8/10)

Too repetitive for some of us, but becomes interesting towards the end.

Favourite Track: The Private Psychedelic Reel

#### [Week 3 - Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentleman We Are Floating In Space](./reviews/Week%203%20-%20Spiritualized%20-%20Ladies%20and%20Gentleman%20We%20Are%20Floating%20In%20Space.md)

26/30 (Me: 9/10)

All in agreement that it was a great album, the middle sagged a little for some of us, but in general each track gave us a lot to talk about.

Favourite Track: Broken Heart

### Theme: Concept Albums
#### [Week 4 - The Kinks - Arthur](./reviews/Week%204%20-%20The%20Kinks%20-%20Arthur%20(Or%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20British%20Empire).md)

23/30 (Me: 8/10)

Not as much love as some albums have received, but a lot of respect from all. The instrumentation, harmonies and satire laced lyrics were all points of note, though the latter 3rd tailed off for us all.

Favourite Tracks: Australia, Yes Sir No Sir, Shangri-La

#### [Week 5 - Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon](./reviews/Week%205%20-%20Pink%20Floyd%20-%20The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon.md)

27/30 (Me: 9/10)

An iconic album in so many ways, through the concepts that run through each track, to the instrumentation and interesting melodies, there was a general tone of sheer enjoyment felt by all of us. Even if we felt the second side was stronger than the first.

Favourite Track: Money

#### Currently listening: Week 6 - Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral
