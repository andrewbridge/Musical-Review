### Theme: 90s
#### [Week 1 - Pixies - Bossanova](./reviews/Week%201%20-%20Pixies%20-%20Bossanova.md)

Some standout tracks, but for some of us, there were forgettable tracks sprinkled throughout.

19/30 (Me: 6/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Cecilia Ann*, Is She Weird, Havalina

#### [Week 2 - The Chemical Brothers - Dig Your Own Hole](./reviews/Week%202%20-%20The%20Chemical%20Brothers%20-%20Dig%20Your%20Own%20Hole.md)

Too repetitive for some of us, but becomes interesting towards the end.

21/30 (Me: 8/10)

Favourite Tracks: *The Private Psychedelic Reel*, Lost in the K-Hole, Where Do I Begin?

#### [Week 3 - Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentleman We Are Floating In Space](./reviews/Week%203%20-%20Spiritualized%20-%20Ladies%20and%20Gentleman%20We%20Are%20Floating%20In%20Space.md)

All in agreement that it was a great album, the middle sagged a little for some of us, but in general each track gave us a lot to talk about.

26/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Broken Heart*, Ladies and Gentleman We Are Floating In Space, I Think I'm in Love

### Theme: Concept Albums
#### [Week 4 - The Kinks - Arthur](./reviews/Week%204%20-%20The%20Kinks%20-%20Arthur%20(Or%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20British%20Empire).md)

Not as much love as some albums have received, but a lot of respect from all. The instrumentation, harmonies and satire laced lyrics were all points of note, though the latter 3rd tailed off for us all.

23/30 (Me: 8/10)

Favourite Tracks: Australia, Yes Sir No Sir, Shangri-La

#### [Week 5 - Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon](./reviews/Week%205%20-%20Pink%20Floyd%20-%20The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon.md)

An iconic album in so many ways, through the concepts that run through each track, to the instrumentation and interesting melodies, there was a general tone of sheer enjoyment felt by all of us. Even if we felt the second side was stronger than the first.

27/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Money*, Us and Them, Time

#### [Week 6 - Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral](./reviews/Week%206%20-%20Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20-%20The%20Downward%20Spiral.md)

After the longest discusson yet, The Downward Spiral comes as close to a perfect concept album as possible. Connecting with us all and prompting a large discussion as well as a lot of reading surrounding the album and the themes that feature.

28/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: Closer, Ruiner, A Warm Place

### Theme: 80s
#### [Week 7 - Tom Waits - Rain Dogs](./reviews/Week%207%20-%20Tom%20Waits%20-%20Rain%20Dogs.md)

While purposeful, the chaotic effect produced by the track order worked better for some of us than others. But we all agreed Tom Waits has a distinctive voice which carries a natural, earthy and interesting album throughout.

21/30 (Me: 6/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Clap Hands*, 9Th & Hennepin, Tango Till They're Sore

### New Release
#### [Week 8 - Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly](./reviews/Week%208%20-%20Kendrick%20Lamar%20-%20To%20Pimp%20A%20Butterfly.md)

For "To Pimp A Butterfly" to be released at this time makes it especially poignant. The themes Kendrick Lamar touches on throughout the album are hard-hitting at times, and wrapped in a well told, evocative story. To add to this, we all agreed that the album was instrumentally great, and generally enjoyable to listen to to top it off. An incredibly important album of 2015.

27/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Mortal Man*, How Much A Dollar Cost, King Kunta

### Theme: 80s
#### [Week 9 - New Order - Power, Corruption And Lies](./reviews/Week%209%20-%20New%20Order%20-%20Power,%20Corruption%20And%20Lies.md)

Without the sentimental feelings of hearing the album at the time, we were universally disappointed by 'Power, Corruption And Lies'. With robotically tight drum patterns to the point of soulessness, vocals that we didn't connect with at all, and track lengths that seemed overly long, we were all left cold by almost everything on the album.

14/30 (Me: 4/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Age of Consent*, Your Silent Face, Leave Me Alone

### New Release
#### [Week 10 - Death Grips - The Powers That B](./reviews/Week%2010%20-%20Death%20Grips%20-%20The%20Powers%20That%20B.md)

An overwhelming, crazy wall of sound, let down by its length, where the two sides could've been separate. Despite that, we thoroughly enjoyed The Powers That B, revelling in its madness, experimentation and humour, even if it did prove to be exhaustive by the end.

21/30 (Me: 7/10)

Favourite Tracks: *On GP*, Why A Bitch Gotta Lie, Pss Pss

### Theme: 80s
#### [Week 11 - U2 - The Joshua Tree](./reviews/Week%2011%20-%20U2%20-%20The%20Joshua%20Tree.md)

Making for an interesting discussion of differing preferences, The Joshua Tree provided an enjoyable listen. With notable production from Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, innovative instrumentation and a poeticism throughout, we all found a lot to say, even if it didn't connect with everyone.

22/30 (Me: 6/10)

Favourite Tracks: *With Or Without You*, *Bullet The Blue Sky*, Exit

### New Release
#### [Week 12 - Squarepusher - Damogen Furies](./reviews/Week%2012%20-%20Squarepusher%20-%20Damogen%20Furies.md)

Damogen Furies made for a hard listen, but with all above average scores, we appreciated the sheer complexity of the album. More manic than some of Squarepusher's previous work, this latest album provided moments of euphoria and headaches simultaneously. A well-focused entry to his catalogue.

21/30 (Me: 7/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Exjag Nives*, Baltang Arg, Stor Eiglass

### Theme: Teen Favourite
#### [Week 13 - Gorillaz - Demon Days](./reviews/Week%2013%20-%20Gorillaz%20-%20Demon%20Days.md)

A decade on from its release, Demon Days gave us a lot to talk about and made for an enjoyable listen for all. While eclectic, nothing about the album seems incoherent, and the fact that we didn't find an "essential" track from the album only stands as testament to the strength of each track individually.

26/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: Kids with Guns, Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head, Feel Good Inc

### New Release
#### [Week 14 - Blur - The Magic Whip](./reviews/Week%2014%20-%20Blur%20-%20The%20Magic%20Whip.md)

A new album from Blur had us all excited, but unfortunately the five day jam in Hong Kong that birthed most of the album didn't seem like long enough to create anything more than a pleasant listen. Between the pacing and the lifelessness of some tracks, The Magic Whip didn't inspire much more than frustration and disappointment.

18/30

Favourite Tracks: Mirrorball, Lonesome Street, My Terracotta Heart

### Theme: Teen Favourite
#### [Week 15 - The Beatles - Revolver](./reviews/Week%2015%20-%20The%20Beatles%20-%20Revolver.md)

Any output from The Beatles has had such a huge amount of coverage that there's little left to say. However, Revolver is still a great listen that packs so much into a well rounded, cohesive and varied album and left us all with a reminder of some hidden gems throughout the album.

26/30

Favourite Tracks: Eleanor Rigby, Tomorrow Never Knows, I'm Only Sleeping

### New Release
#### [Week 16 - San Fermin - Jackrabbit](./reviews/Week%2016%20-%20San%20Fermin%20-%20Jackrabbit.md)

An unexpected listen from an unknown artist for some of us, Jackrabbit provided a good discussion. However, between the interesting mix of instrumentation and genre, there were a few tracks that weren't as strong which ultimately let the album down to an extent.

22/30

Favourite Tracks: Emily, The Cave, Jackrabbit

### Theme: Teen Favourite
#### [Week 17 - Muse - Origin of Symmetry](./reviews/Week%2017%20-%20Muse%20-%20Origin%20of%20Symmetry.md)

An album that has a special place in all of our hearts but even objectively, we came to the conclusion that Origin of Symmetry is still worth a listen more than a decade after its release. Its variety and rawness create a memorable album, with its only faults being the slight loss of direction and occassional roughness in execution.

26/30

Favourite Tracks: *Citizen Erased*, Bliss, New Born

### New Release
#### [Week 18 - Muse - Drones](./reviews/Week%2018%20-%20Muse%20-%20Drones.md)

An album that aligned our opinions and caused both disappointment and elation. In the end our favourite tracks all being the same speaks far louder than a summary could. Had there been more that were similar to our favourites, Drones could've done well. Had there been more Drone Kings, we probably wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. As it is, Drones is mediocre for the most part.

17/30

Favourite Tracks: *Defector*, *The Handler*, *Reapers*

### Theme: 70s
#### [Week 19 - Neil Young - On The Beach](./reviews/Week%2019%20-%20Neil%20Young%20-%20On%20The%20Beach.md)

A week where few words were needed. On The Beach provided for a lot of enjoyment and yet none of us could quite articulate why we had enjoyed it so much. A great listen which really speaks louder in its lyrical and instrumental content than any of us were able to truly put in to words.

27/30

Favourite Tracks: *On The Beach*, Walk On, Ambulance Blues

### New Release
#### [Week 20 - Jaga Jazzist - Starfire](./reviews/Week%2020%20-%20Jaga%20Jazzist%20-%20Starfire.md)

Jaga Jazzist surprised us this week with their latest release. A melting pot of electronic, pop and jazz music provided for an energetic, ever-changing listen. However, with the memorable moments scattered across the live jam-like tracks, Starfire ultimately didn't move us to anything more than mild approval and a curiosity to explore their previous albums.

19/30

Favourite tracks: *Shinkansen*, *Starfire*, Big City Music

### Theme: 70s
#### [Week 21 - Bob Marley and The Wailers - Exodus](./reviews/Week%2021%20-%20Bob%20Marley%20and%20The%20Wailers%20-%20Exodus.md)

With a lot to live up to, Exodus fell just short of the classic album we were expecting, some tracks initially floating by without recognition, the album only really caught out interest in the latter half. Though we certainly all enjoyed it, and appreciate just how big an impact the album has made worldwide, over time, Exodus simply didn't make us feel a great deal.

20/30

Favourite Tracks: *Jamming*, One Love/People Get Ready, Exodus

### New Release
#### [Week 22 - Wolf Alice - My Love Is Cool](./reviews/Week%2022%20-%20Wolf%20Alice%20-%20My%20Love%20Is%20Cool.md)

We were all left intrigued at the potential of Wolf Alice after listening to their debut album. With so many genres being covered in the tracklist of My Love Is Cool, we've all enjoyed different parts of the album, and are hopeful for what comes next for Wolf Alice.

21/30

Favourite Tracks: *Giant Peach*, Freazy, Fluffy

### Theme: 70s
#### [Week 23 - David Bowie - Low](./reviews/Week%2023%20-%20David%20Bowie%20-%20Low.md)

Low lured us in with its first side of short and sweet glam-rock and made us stay with the second side of curious soundscapes. With us all noting its attention to detail and clarity, Low provides for a great listen and reaffirms why Bowie is still so relevant and influential today

27/30

Favourite Tracks: Sound and Vision, Speed of Life, Warszawa

### New Release
#### [Week 24 - Lianne La Havas - Blood](./reviews/Week%2024%20-%20Lianne%20La%20Havas%20-%20Blood.md)

Blood definitely has some interesting moments, but each of us agreed that the extra instrumentation sometimes felt a little needless and lifeless in contrast the La Havas' vocals. Nevertheless, it hasn't dampened our interest in the artist and the slightly stripped back sound from the previous album.

19/30

Favourite Tracks: *Midnight*, Wonderful, What You Don't Do

### Theme: Misunderstood Albums
#### Currently listening: Week 25 - Public Image Ltd - 9
