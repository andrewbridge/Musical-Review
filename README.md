# Musical Review
I review an album each week with some friends, this seemed like a good place to store things. See the summary below, or the individual files in the reviews directory.

### Theme: 90s
#### [Week 1 - Pixies - Bossanova](./reviews/Week%201%20-%20Pixies%20-%20Bossanova.md)

Some standout tracks, but for some of us, there were forgettable tracks sprinkled throughout.

19/30 (Me: 6/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Cecilia Ann*, Is She Weird, Havalina

#### [Week 2 - The Chemical Brothers - Dig Your Own Hole](./reviews/Week%202%20-%20The%20Chemical%20Brothers%20-%20Dig%20Your%20Own%20Hole.md)

Too repetitive for some of us, but becomes interesting towards the end.

21/30 (Me: 8/10)

Favourite Tracks: *The Private Psychedelic Reel*, Lost in the K-Hole, Where Do I Begin?

#### [Week 3 - Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentleman We Are Floating In Space](./reviews/Week%203%20-%20Spiritualized%20-%20Ladies%20and%20Gentleman%20We%20Are%20Floating%20In%20Space.md)

All in agreement that it was a great album, the middle sagged a little for some of us, but in general each track gave us a lot to talk about.

26/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Broken Heart*, Ladies and Gentleman We Are Floating In Space, I Think I'm in Love

### Theme: Concept Albums
#### [Week 4 - The Kinks - Arthur](./reviews/Week%204%20-%20The%20Kinks%20-%20Arthur%20(Or%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20British%20Empire).md)

Not as much love as some albums have received, but a lot of respect from all. The instrumentation, harmonies and satire laced lyrics were all points of note, though the latter 3rd tailed off for us all.

23/30 (Me: 8/10)

Favourite Tracks: Australia, Yes Sir No Sir, Shangri-La

#### [Week 5 - Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon](./reviews/Week%205%20-%20Pink%20Floyd%20-%20The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon.md)

An iconic album in so many ways, through the concepts that run through each track, to the instrumentation and interesting melodies, there was a general tone of sheer enjoyment felt by all of us. Even if we felt the second side was stronger than the first.

27/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Money*, Us and Them, Time

#### [Week 6 - Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral](./reviews/Week%206%20-%20Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20-%20The%20Downward%20Spiral.md)

After the longest discusson yet, The Downward Spiral comes as close to a perfect concept album as possible. Connecting with us all and prompting a large discussion as well as a lot of reading surrounding the album and the themes that feature.

28/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: Closer, Ruiner, A Warm Place

### Theme: 80s
#### [Week 7 - Tom Waits - Rain Dogs](./reviews/Week%207%20-%20Tom%20Waits%20-%20Rain%20Dogs.md)

While purposeful, the chaotic effect produced by the track order worked better for some of us than others. But we all agreed Tom Waits has a distinctive voice which carries a natural, earthy and interesting album throughout.

21/30 (Me: 6/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Clap Hands*, 9Th & Hennepin, Tango Till They're Sore

### New Release
#### [Week 8 - Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly](./reviews/Week%208%20-%20Kendrick%20Lamar%20-%20To%20Pimp%20A%20Butterfly.md)

For "To Pimp A Butterfly" to be released at this time makes it especially poignant. The themes Kendrick Lamar touches on throughout the album are hard-hitting at times, and wrapped in a well told, evocative story. To add to this, we all agreed that the album was instrumentally great, and generally enjoyable to listen to to top it off. An incredibly important album of 2015.

27/30 (Me: 9/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Mortal Man*, How Much A Dollar Cost, King Kunta

### Theme: 80s
#### [Week 9 - New Order - Power, Corruption And Lies](./reviews/Week%209%20-%20New%20Order%20-%20Power,%20Corruption%20And%20Lies.md)

Without the sentimental feelings of hearing the album at the time, we were universally disappointed by 'Power, Corruption And Lies'. With robotically tight drum patterns to the point of soulessness, vocals that we didn't connect with at all, and track lengths that seemed overly long, we were all left cold by almost everything on the album.

14/30 (Me: 4/10)

Favourite Tracks: *Age of Consent*, Your Silent Face, Leave Me Alone

### New Release
#### [Week 10 - Death Grips - The Powers That B](./reviews/Week%2010%20-%20Death%20Grips%20-%20The%20Powers%20That%20B.md)

An overwhelming, crazy wall of sound, let down by its length, where the two sides could've been separate. Despite that, we thoroughly enjoyed The Powers That B, revelling in its madness, experimentation and humour, even if it did prove to be exhaustive by the end.

21/30 (Me: 7/10)

Favourite Tracks: *On GP*, Why A Bitch Gotta Lie, Pss Pss

### Theme: 80s
#### [Week 11 - U2 - The Joshua Tree](./reviews/Week%2011%20-%20U2%20-%20The%20Joshua%20Tree.md)

Making for an interesting discussion of differing preferences, The Joshua Tree provided an enjoyable listen. With notable production from Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, innovative instrumentation and a poeticism throughout, we all found a lot to say, even if it didn't connect with everyone.

22/30 (Me: 6/10)

Favourite Tracks: *With Or Without You*, *Bullet The Blue Sky*, Exit

### New Release
#### Currently listening: Week 12 - Squarepusher - Damogen Furies
