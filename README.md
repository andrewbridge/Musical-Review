# Musical Review
I review an album each week with some friends, this seemed like a good place to store things. See the summary below, or the individual files in the reviews directory.

## Summary

### Theme: 90s
#### [Week 1 - Pixies - Bossa Nova](https://github.com/andrewbridge/Musical-Review/blob/master/reviews/Week%201%20-%20Pixies%20-%20Bossa%20Nova.md)

19/30 (Me: 6/10)

Some standout tracks, but sags in places.

Favourite Track: Cecilia Ann

#### [Week 2 - The Chemical Brothers - Dig Your Own Hole](https://github.com/andrewbridge/Musical-Review/blob/master/reviews/Week%202%20-%20The%20Chemical%20Brothers%20-%20Dig%20Your%20Own%20Hole.md)

Too repetitive for some of us, but becomes interesting towards the end.

Favourite Track: The Private Psychedelic Reel
