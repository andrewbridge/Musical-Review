# Week 1 - [Pixies - Bossanova](http://www.allmusic.com/album/bossanova-mw0000690015)
*Theme: 90s*

## Andre said:

"Without the raw energy of Surfer Rosa and cohesiveness of Doolittle, Bossanova is simply a solid album from a remarkable band. By no means their best work, but an enjoyable listen nonetheless (even if a few tracks do drift by)."

7/10

Favourite Tracks: All Over The World, Cecilia Ann, The Happening

## Fred said:

"I found a lot of Bossanova to be quite forgettable. There is a handful of good tracks, but the album as a whole fails to build up a head of steam. It isn't bad by any means, though, and certainly merits a listen."

6/10

Favourite Tracks: Havalina, Is She Weird, Cecilia Ann
