"Jason Pierce sculptured a magnificent journey for listeners to experience. Tortured themes, fragile vocals, irresistibly groovy basslines, beautifully spacious production, and such a curious closer. Ladies and Gentleman We Are Floating In Space has numerous key components. A special album, and one I love dearly."

"I thought the album was quite beautiful. You find new things to admire each time you listen, and I listened to it a lot this week. That said, the middle portion lost me a little, thought I'd imagine that's partially because the opening and closings are so wonderful."

8/10

Favourite Tracks: Cop Shoot Cop, I Think I'm In Love, Broken Heart

"I think we've actually spoken about this one less because we've all just been in agreement. It's a great album, it held my attention almost the whole way through with the continually changing and layering sounds. It was great, I'll definitely be revisiting it."
