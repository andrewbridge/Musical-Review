"I knew I liked the album a lot, but I hadn't listened to it in almost 2 years. I now love it. The album feels like a journey and it's so well sculptured. Love the themes. Love the basslines. Love the fragile vocals and lyrics. Love the production. It’s a long album, and you can tell, but it certainly doesn’t overstay it's welcome. There’s only one track which doesn't resonate with me. And such a curious closer… makes you think really. But overall, I think that this is actually a rather special album."

9/10

"I thought the album was quite beautiful. You find new things to admire each time you listen, and I listened to it a lot this week. That said, the middle portion lost me a little, thought I'd imagine that's partially because the opening and closings are so wonderful."

"I think we've actually spoken about this one less because we've all just been in agreement. It's a great album, it held my attention almost the whole way through with the continually changing and layering sounds. It was great, I'll definitely be revisiting it."
