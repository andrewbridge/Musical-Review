"It's a special album in a lot of ways. But, I do still say the second half is considerably stronger. The first side is good, and the second side is brilliant. So if I'm gonna be brutal in conclusion, I would say that, in that sense, it perhaps falls a tad short of the greatness than it so often gets accoladed with."

"It's just sublime. I wish I could articulate better as to why, but I'm not sure I can. Dark Side of the Moon is one of those high-water marks of creativity and expression. If I wasn't such a surly git it probably would have changed my life. I've chosen favourites, but you really should just listen to it all in one go."

10/10

Favourite Tracks: Money, The Great Gig in the Sky, Time

"I think the fact that I feel almost drained after listening to this album proves that Dark Side of the Moon certainly makes me feel something more than an average album, takes me on a journey. There are some stand out tracks, but together, with the range of instruments and the interesting time signatures and melodies sprinkled through it, it really can put you in a dream like trance, which isn't an easy thing to achieve!"

9/10

Favourite Tracks: Money, Breathe (In The Air), Any Colour You Like
