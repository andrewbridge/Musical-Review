"Undeniably special, The Dark Side of the Moon is an iconic record that will stand the test of time. I do feel, however, that one side is considerably stronger than the other - the first half is a good album, and the second half is a brilliant one. In that sense I'd suggest that it perhaps falls a tad short of the greatness that it so often gets accoladed with."

Favourite Tracks: Money, Us and Them, Brain Damage

"The Dark Side of the Moon is one of those high-water marks of artistic expression. It's just sublime. I don't have a bad thing to say about it. I think the two halves need each other, their relationship not unlike the one shared by the beam of light and the prism that adorn the iconic cover. If I wasn't such an impassive git this album probably would have changed my life. I've chosen favourites, but you really should just listen to it all in one go."

10/10

Favourite Tracks: Money, The Great Gig in the Sky, Time

## Andrew said:

"I think the fact that I feel almost drained after listening to this album proves that Dark Side of the Moon certainly makes me feel something more than an average album, takes me on a journey. There are some stand out tracks, but together, with the range of instruments and the interesting time signatures and melodies sprinkled through it, it really can put you in a dream like trance, which isn't an easy thing to achieve!"
