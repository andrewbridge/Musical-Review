The Musical Review began 1st February 2015.

The schedule we ran by was originally a simple three week cycle, where each of us chose an album which related to a chosen theme. At the end of the three week cycle, a new theme would be chosen by majority vote.

Starting from 15th March 2015, we added in a fortnightly "New Release" week, where we chose a new release from the last month to review. This allowed us to break away from our theme, and keep the spread of albums we reviewed relatively wide.

The new six week cycle is as follows:
* Fred's theme choice
* Group voted "New Release" choice
* Andrew's theme choice
* Group voted "New Release" choice
* Andre's theme choice
* Group voted "New Release" choice
